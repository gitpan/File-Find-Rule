=head1 NAME

File::Find::Rule - Alternative interface to File::Find

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::Find::Rule;
  # find all the subdirectories of a given directory
  my @subdirs = File::Find::Rule->directory->in( $directory );

  # find all the .pm files in @INC
  my @files = File::Find::Rule->file()
                              ->name( '*.pm' )
                              ->in( @INC );

=head1 HISTORY

What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.26 Monday 10th November, 2003

	Typo/thinko in File::Find::Rule::Extending corrected (spotted
	by Jim Cromie)

	Optimization to the stat-based tests.  They now compile to code
	fragments saving much subroutine dispatch.


=item 0.25 Wednesday 22nd October, 2003

	applied a patch from Leon Brocard to make the tests ignore CVS dirs
	as well as .svn dirs.

	reworked part of t/File-Find-Rule.t to not assume that t/foobar will
	always be 10 bytes in size. (rt.cpan.org #3838)

	now we install the findrule script


=item 0.24 Monday 6th October, 2003

	when you specify an extra of C<{ follow => 1 }> File::Find stops
	populating $File::Find::topdir.  This leads to warnings noise so
	instead we now track $topdir ourselves.
