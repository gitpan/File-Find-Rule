README for File::Find::Rule 0.20_03

=head1 NAME

File::Find::Rule - Alternative interface to File::Find

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::Find::Rule;
  # find all the subdirectories of a given directory
  my @subdirs = File::Find::Rule->directory->in( $directory );

  # find all the .pm files in @INC
  my @files = File::Find::Rule->file()
                              ->name( '*.pm' )
                              ->in( @INC );

  # as above, but without method chaining
  my $rule =  File::Find::Rule->new;
  $rule->file;
  $rule->name( '*.pm' );
  my @files = $rule->in( @INC );

=head1 HISTORY

What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.20_03 4th August, 2003

	- Fix maxdepth? - this is undertested.


=item 0.20_02 25th June, 2003

	- MANIFEST fixes (thanks to the cpan smokers)


=item 0.20_01	22nd June 2003

	- split the documentation of the procedural interface out to
	  File::Find::Rule::Procedural, as people often seem to get
	  confused that the method calls don't take anonymous arrays
	  after seeing the procedural code that did

	- Chunky internal restructure.  Now we compile a match sub
	  from code fragments.  Though more complex, this is a big
	  speed win as it eliminates a lot of the subroutine dispatch.

	- During the restructure we lost the ->test method.  I hope
	  that it's not missed, since maintining it through a
	  deprecation cycle would be fiddly with the current _compile code.

	- Split the findrule tests into their own file, and just skip
	  the tricky ones on Win32.
